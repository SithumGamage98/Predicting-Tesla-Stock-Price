#### This repository contains the code and documentation for our 4th year Machine Learning Module assignment. In this project, we utilized a dataset to apply various machine learning algorithms and evaluate their performance.

### Overview
#### Our objective is to explore the dataset, preprocess it, apply machine learning algorithms, and assess their effectiveness through test results. We employed Python as the programming language and utilized Jupyter Notebook as the programming environment for better code visualization and documentation.
